A static website that showcases a rock-paper-scissor game.

# Rationale
This is a project that aims to showcase my fundamental web dev skills. I got the design from Frontend Mentors. Unfortunately, it was too late when I realized that the challenge was for **Advanced** people. For context, I only started learning last 2 weeks. Nonetheless, I'm proud that I got fairly close to the reference without referring to any tutorials. The challenge also includes a mobile view but I'll come and polish this up once I learn about CSS animations and responsive design :D
